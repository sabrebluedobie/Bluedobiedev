            <article class="description"><h2>Techopedia Explains Front-End Developer:</h2><br>
              A front-end developer is a programmer that codes the front end of a website. Typically, the front-end developer&apos;s job is to convert website design files into raw HTML, JavaScript (JS) and/or CSS code. This includes the basic website design/layout, images, content, buttons, navigation and internal links. The end result is code that serves as the website&apos;s front-end structure, which is used by a back-end developer to add business logics and connect databases and processes, among other processes.<br><br>
              A front-end developer is responsible for ensuring that a website's visual front end is free of errors and looks exactly as designed. A front-end developer also ensures that a website has the same visibility across different computing and mobile Web browsers.<br><br>
              Similarly, in software applications, a front-end web developer creates the graphical user interface (GUI) that enables access to the software&apos;s back-end features and capabilities.<br><br>

              <h2>Valentine Cheronoh of "Computing for Geeks" Discusses Front End Developing</h2><br><br>
              Web Design<br>
Basically, the major thing that comes from front-end developers is web design.  They are professionals of making web pages the most functional that they can be, all while making them visually pleasing and aesthetic to the eye.<br><br>

They also are responsible for making the web design very responsive and optimized for smartphones, because more and more website traffic is done from smartphones every year.<br><br>
Redesigning UI and UX<br>
If you think that redesigning the user interface of your existing software, a front-end developer would make for a great consultant in the process.  Many agencies that focus on this are busy because it makes sense for a company to constantly look for ways to innovate.<br><br>

Instead of building a completely new software, it makes sense to see what kind of options are out there for your software and see if it would be worth pursuing.<br><br>  

Back-End<br>
I know that this post is focused on what a front-end developer does, but you would be surprised that most agencies with front-end developers also are experienced with the back-end side of things.<br><br>

In my opinion, it makes sense to find an agency that specializes in both because it is less friction from two agencies working on your website or software, and it simplifies the whole entire process by using an agency that can do it all for you.<br><br>

Back-end development deals more with function ability and the backbone of whatever you are trying to build.  If you shop around it is pretty easy to find agencies that are experienced and have a great track record in both back-end and front-end.<br><br>

Those are just some of the main services that are offered by front-end developers and their agencies, but there are other services that were not mentioned.  If you feel like this post helped you gain any knowledge, then please go ahead and share it with someone else!<br><br>
