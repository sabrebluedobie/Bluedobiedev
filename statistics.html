10. … but the average mobile landing page takes 7 seconds to load<br><br>
Despite consumers wanting their pages to load in less than three seconds, the average load speed for a page is more than double this. Not only is this bad for user experience but it can also have a big impact on SEO.<br>

As of August 2021, the algorithm will take into account load speeds when determining which pages will rank. This is great news for consumers that prefer speedy loading, but bad news for website owners if your site has slow load speeds.<br>

11. Website users look at the top left corner of your website first<br><br>
This is the ‘primary optical area’ and it’s where the user’s eyes are first drawn. Designers can use this knowledge about how your customers’ gaze moves across their page to influence their landing page layouts. For example, you might want to move your value proposition or whatever elements you want your customers to see first to the top left corner of the page<br>

12. Website viewers spend 80% of their time looking at the left half of your pages

13. 70% of small businesses don’t have a CTA on their website homepage
CTA’s also known as ‘calls to action’ are a key component of good web design. They encourage users to take action which drives conversions, lead generation, and sales.

14. Users spend 5.94 seconds looking at the main website image, on average
Images are also extremely important when it comes to design. With the average user spending around 6 seconds looking at the main website images, it’s extremely important that this image is professional and relevant.

Images do a great job of grabbing the user’s attention, so there’s no point wasting this impact by filling your page with an irrelevant stock image instead of something that could help you create a great first impression.
